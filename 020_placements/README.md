[`placements.csv`](placements.csv) lists all first placements for students from the JEL lists with year of placement and - if meaningful - with the rank of the first placement.  Lower-case names are students not in the JEL lists.

The names of universities in column "placement" correspond to the names used by the Journal of Economic Literature used in their annual lists of Doctoral Dissertations (see folder [`000_raw_student_lists`](../000_raw_student_lists)).  They are later mapped to the names used in the rankings.
